# Self-Healing-System-for-Automated-Remediation
 The Self-Healing System automates detection and remediation of system issues such as disk space, network
 failures, and service interruptions. Integrates monitoring (Prometheus, Nagios), automation (Python,
 Ansible), and orchestration (Kubernetes, AWS Lambda) to ensure system reliability.
